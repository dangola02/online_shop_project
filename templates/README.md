## Introduction
We are a worldwide virtual exchanging stage that gives an opportunity to purchase household products and producers from China, as well as Russia, Europe, Turkey and other nations. Items on the location are sold at retail and little discount. In Kazakhstan we have no application for middle age people like ours. Therefore, our project is as simple as possible and easy-absorbed.

## Requirements analysis

**To make the project successful:**

* Build a great team
  1. A manager who organizes everything and is experienced in his business. Connecting all the workers so as not to lose the spirit of teamwork.
  2.	An analyst who anticipates future problems or who is able to evaluate the market and give accurate solutions in their favor.
  3.	Experienced programmers who not only know how to Google but also create real things that are not inferior to large companies.

*	A good company slogan is a good advertisement for the market itself and the owner of all this.
Make ads on websites, in television. Rent billboards.
* Quite affordable prices of services for all people who want to get their goods. And there are also discounts, etc.

## Project relevance
Because, now is the time when a person can buy anything without leaving their home, the main thing is to have access to the global network. If earlier people went to buy, for example, a jacket or furniture, they came to the store, looked at the goods and some of them might be missing. And now everything has become much easier. Now you can just go to the manufacturer's website, see what they produce. There you can see the entire range of products and make an order there. Despite the simplicity of the choice and purchase, the product still needs to be delivered. And if the manufacturer of conditional furniture does not have branches in our country, the delivery can take about a month. And so there was an idea to create a store for the sale of goods at the lowest price. The bottom line is that working directly with the manufacturers of goods, we exclude intermediaries, which will help reduce the price. Delivery and storage will also be carried out without an intermediary. Also, we will not have sales points, instead there will be an online store where the sale will be carried out.

## Risk and dependencies
In Kazakhstan, there is an example of this kind of business, this is Kaspi. They also do not have retail outlets, and all purchases are made online in the app. But they receive goods from third-party firms with which they cooperate and receive a percentage of sales. Our business will be different in that we will not have any third-party companies at all, and we will buy all the goods from the manufacturers of the goods themselves. This allows you to reduce the cost of delivery and the price of the product. And this in turn can attract more customers.

## Target audience
Due to the fact that the prices of the proposed products will be lower than in other stores, presumably the buyers will be people with low incomes. Also, if there is a competent advertising, then in principle, the store can be used by wealthy people. But in order to start buying goods from us, you need to advertise the store very well and make prices affordable for the masses.

## Product quality and price level
Industrial enterprises produce products in the right quantity, range and quality that meet the needs of the consumer, as well as provide commercial activities for the sale of finished products. In the conditions of market relations, its role increases, and its tasks become more complex. Therefore, our domestic products, as orders and reviews show a worthy struggle with competitors. When choosing a product, you should know about the availability of permanent special offers at reduced prices, collective purchases and discount coupons, the section with which is located on the main page of the site.

## Design
*	Searching system\
Through our search engine, you can even find a needle in a haystack. Our algorithms and their complex of computer programs provide the user with the ability to quickly access the goods you need or the services;
*	Menu\
In our service, you can find the products in different categories in the conditionally called "menu" for yourself or family and friends. Using the menu and special filters, you can choose a thing at a certain price;
*	Category of products\
In the "categories" you can immediately start the search by certain goods in the desired category you have chosen;
*	Registering system\
Our registration system is quick and convenient, without unnecessary problems. After that you can immediately start shopping;
*	Feedback system\

*	Product tracking system\

*	Wish list\
Any user can add a product or service to the "Wish list";
*	Shopping cart\
You can add several items to the shopping cart at once to make a payment at once for all the products you have selected, which makes shopping very easy;

## Delivery
More than 80% of sellers offer free shipping via KazPost. These carriers do not differ in the speed of delivery and, if time is not important for you, choose free delivery. If you need to get the goods as quickly as possible, then choose courier services. Courier delivery is significantly more expensive and the cost depends on the weight of the parcel. Such as DHL, Yandex Mail Pony Express, etc. Keep in mind that orders from different sellers are not combined into one package, so you will have to pay for each one separately. Even from one supplier, different goods may well come in different package.

## Communication strategy
Cooperate with postal and courier services, such as Yandex Delivery, Kazpost, DHL, Pony express. For convenient and fast delivery of products to customers. The main thing is to negotiate with the delivery services. Because it is impossible to deliver to all addresses on your own. We also need to negotiate with providers of products directly from the factory, which will significantly reduce the price of products. Do not forget about the advertising campaign. Good advertising will increase the number of customers, and this will increase the profit.
